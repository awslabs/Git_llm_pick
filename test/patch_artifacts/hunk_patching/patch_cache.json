The change is straightforward, adding a conditional to return 0 and print an error message if the divisor is zero. The destination code, however, uses a different variable name for the second parameter of the `divide` function (`b` instead of `divisor`). To apply the hunk correctly, we need to adjust the variable name in the conditional check to match the destination code.\n\n### CHANGE SUMMARY\n\n- Adjusted the variable name in the conditional check from `divisor` to `b` to match the destination code.\n\n### ADAPTED CODE SNIPPET\n\n```c\n   14  }\n   15  \n   16  // Function to multiply two integers\n   17  int multiply(int a, int b) {\n   18      return a * b;\n   19  }\n   20  \n   21  // Function to divide two integers\n   22  float divide(int a, int b) {\n   23      if (b == 0) {\n   24          printf(\"Error: Division by zero\\n\");\n   25          return 0;\n   26      }\n   27      return (float)a / b;\n   28  }\n   29  \n   30  int main() {\n   31      int x = 10;\n   32      int y = 5;\n   33  \n   34      printf(\"Testing basic arithmetic operations:\\n\");\n   35      printf(\"x = %d, y = %d\\n\", x, y);\n```\n\nNote: Line numbers have been added to the code snippet for clarity.", "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0", "query": "# Hunk Patching\n\nI want to apply a commit to another branch.
