The source code uses `b` as the divisor, while the hunk uses `divisor`. To apply the hunk to the destination code, I need to ensure that the variable name matches the destination code's variable name, which is `b`. Additionally, the function signature in the hunk uses `divisor` instead of `b`, so I need to adjust that as well.\n\n### CHANGE SUMMARY\n\n- Changed the parameter name in the function signature from `divisor` to `b` to match the destination code.\n- Adjusted the division by zero check to use `b` instead of `divisor`.\n\n### ADAPTED CODE SNIPPET\n\n```c\n   14  }\n   15  \n   16  // Function to multiply two integers\n   17  int multiply(int a, int b) {\n   18      return a * b;\n   19  }\n   20  \n   21  // Function to divide two integers\n   22  float divide(int a, int b) {\n   23      if (b == 0) {\n   24          printf(\"Error: Division by zero\\n\");\n   25          return 0;\n   26      }\n   27      return (float)a / b;\n   28  }\n   29  \n   30  int main() {\n   31      int x = 10;\n   32      int y = 5;\n   33  \n   34      printf(\"Testing basic arithmetic operations:\\n\");\n   35      printf(\"x = %d, y = %d\\n\", x, y);\n```\n\nIn this adapted code snippet, the division by zero check has been correctly applied to the `divide` function, ensuring that the variable names match the destination code.", "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0", "query": "# Hunk Patching\n\nI want to apply a commit to another branch.
