{"97fc0c955f54279698856c5305347c3b": {"answer": "### EXPLANATION\n\nThe provided patch aims to adjust the `diff_array` function to account for the difference in elements between two arrays, considering both the common elements and the elements that are only present in one of the arrays. The patch adds a loop to subtract the elements of the second array that are not present in the first array. \n\nIn the source code, the function already includes a loop to add the elements of the first array that are not present in the second array. However, in the destination code, this loop is missing. To apply the patch, we need to first add the missing loop to the destination code and then apply the provided patch.\n\n### CHANGE SUMMARY\n\n- Added the missing loop to the `diff_array` function in the destination code to sum the elements of the first array that are not present in the second array.\n- Applied the provided patch to subtract the elements of the second array that are not present in the first array.\n\n### ADAPTED CODE SNIPPET\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid print_array(int arr[], int size) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\nint diff_array(int arr1[], int arr2[], int size1, int size2) {\n    int diff = 0;\n    int min_size = size1 < size2 ? size1 : size2;\n    for (int i = 0; i < min_size; i++) {\n        diff += arr1[i] - arr2[i];\n    }\n    for (int i = min_size; i < size1; i++) {\n        diff += arr1[i];\n    }\n    for (int i = min_size; i < size2; i++) {\n        diff -= arr2[i];\n    }\n    return diff;\n}\n```", "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0", "query": "# Section Patching\n\n\nI have a patch that does not cleanly apply to code.
