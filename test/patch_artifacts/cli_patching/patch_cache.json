{"7639cf51b8953e28699077b3fe547a71": {"answer": "### EXPLANATION\n\nThe provided patch aims to add a new loop to the `diff_array` function that subtracts elements from the second array (`arr2`) that are not present in the first array (`arr1`). This change is straightforward and should be applied to the destination function with minimal adjustments. The primary difference between the source and destination functions is the absence of the second loop in the destination function that adds elements from `arr1` that are not present in `arr2`. \n\nTo apply the patch, we need to add the new loop to the destination function. Since the destination function is missing the loop that adds elements from `arr1`, we only need to add the new loop that subtracts elements from `arr2`.\n\n### CHANGE SUMMARY\n\n- Added the loop to subtract elements from `arr2` that are not present in `arr1`.\n\n### ADAPTED CODE SNIPPET\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid print_array(int arr[], int size) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\nint diff_array(int arr1[], int arr2[], int size1, int size2) {\n    int diff = 0;\n    int min_size = size1 < size2 ? size1 : size2;\n    for (int i = 0; i < min_size; i++) {\n        diff += arr1[i] - arr2[i];\n    }\n    for (int i = min_size; i < size1; i++) {\n        diff += arr1[i];\n    }\n    for (int i = min_size; i < size2; i++) {\n        diff -= arr2[i];\n    }\n    return diff;\n}\n```", "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0", "query": "# Section Patching\n\n\nI have a patch that does not cleanly apply to code.
